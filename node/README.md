# Node.js Modules

This folder contains examples of how to work with built-in and custom modules in Node.js.
Simple explanation for each file:

- **fileSystem.js**: Learn how to read, write, append, and delete files using the `fs` module.
- **index.js**: Main file that demonstrates how to import and use custom modules.
- **math.js**: A custom module example that exports mathematical functions (add, multiply).
- **path.js**: Utilities for working with file and directory paths using the `path` module.

These examples cover the core concepts of modular programming in Node.js.
