# OOP (Object Oriented Programming)

This folder explains how to write code using Classes and Objects.
Simple Explanation:

- **Class**: It is a Blueprint (Like a map for building house).
- **Object**: Real thing made from Blueprint (The actual house).
- **Inheritance**: taking properties from parent (Like Son taking height from Father).

**Files:**
- `script.js`: Contains Class and Inheritance examples.
